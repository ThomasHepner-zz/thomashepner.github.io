&lt;p&gt;Recommender systems are platforms that try to solve the &lt;strong&gt;recommendation problem&lt;/strong&gt;, in which they seek to predict rating or preference that a user would give to an item.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be mainly reviewing a paper by the Grouplens Social Computing Research team at the University of Minnesota, which introduces the concept of Collaborative Filtering and builds a foundation on Recommender Systems theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;grouplens-grouplens-an-open-architecture-for-collaborative-filtering-of-netnews&quot;&gt;Grouplens: Grouplens: An Open Architecture for Collaborative Filtering of Netnews&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Grouplens paper offers evidence on the work done while trying to make recommendations for users of a news system called Usenet. Basically, a user could rate a post by scoring it from 1 (bad) to 5 (good), but the important thing about it is that the research group relied on the premise that &lt;strong&gt;a user rates an article with the score he/she thinks the platform would suggest&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is then introduced a simple method of rating prediction, using &lt;strong&gt;Pearson’s Correlation&lt;/strong&gt; between other users ratings, in order to predict the rating the active user would give to the un-rated article. In the examples shown in the paper, a positive value of correlation between two users means that they agree more, and a negative value suggests disagreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The predicted rating value is then calculated combining this correlations, in order to fill a user/rating matrix an then use predictions however the systems deems necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the investigation sheds light on the issues natural to the recommendation problem, which will be commented further in following sections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;comments-and-critics&quot;&gt;Comments and critics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, it is interesting to see this paper as a precursor to recommender systems theory. Noting that it was written in 1994, it is impressive to see how visionary the Grouplens team was in discovering this problem and the needs for more specific information filtering. What impresses me is the fact that they were dealing with data traffic close to 100 MB per day, with user postings of over 140,000 articles in a two-week basis, which falls very short to today’s standards and needs for information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper can be rightfully called a precursor to recommender systems theory because of the many investigations that rely upon it. It currently has 1,172 citations in the ACM academic network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I found that the choice of using Pearson’s correlation was poorly explained, and in later investigations it is questioned by some authors, as the data should adapt to very strict models to give confident predictions. For example, the authors of “An Algorithmic Framework for Performing Collaborative Filtering”, five years later mentions that “Pearson’s correlation coefficient is derived from a linear regression model that relies in a set of assumptions regarding the data, namely that the relationship must be linear, and the errors must be independent and have a probability distribution with mean 0 an constant variance for every setting of the independent variable”. It is common to see these assumptions violated, so it is important to understand to which datasets the model adjusts better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, the paper succeeds in determining the scaling issues that these platforms have, and in showing some ways in which they can be tackled. They assessed score prediction’s quality, rating’s posting and prediction’s reception waiting time, and network traffic issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post was interesting as it proposes a simple way for sorting rated items, using the lower bound of Wilson score confidence interval for a Bernoulli parameter. The good part is that the post suggest a couple of ways for implementing the score assignment algorithm, including Excel, Ruby and SQL statements.&lt;/p&gt;
